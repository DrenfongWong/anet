~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The current development version of Anet is available through its git repository:

  $ git clone http://git.codelabs.ch/git/anet.git

A browsable version of the repository is also available here:

Installation
------------
To compile and install Anet on your system, you need to have the following
software installed:

* GNAT Ada compiler:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnat/gnat.html

If you want to run the unit tests before installation of Anet (which is
recommended) you furthermore need to have the following installed:

* Ahven (Test-Framework):
  http://ahven.stronglytyped.org/

Anet supports BSD and Linux operating systems. To build for BSD, append
`OS=bsd` to the `make` commands below. The building and installation process of
Anet is straightforward. Just type in the following commands.

  $ make
  $ make PREFIX=/usr/local install

If neither `PREFIX` nor `OS` are specified, `$(HOME)/libraries` is used as
installation directory and the library is built for Linux.


Testing
-------
Anet contains a comprehensive unit test suite which can be run by entering the
following command:

  $ make tests

All tests should be marked with *PASS* behind the test name. To run the tests
on BSD, type:

  $ make tests OS=bsd
