Anet - Ada Networking Library
=============================

Anet is a networking library for the Ada programming language. The library
provides a BSD socket implementation and support for IPv4/UDP packet creation
and validation. It can be used to implement custom protocols on top of IPv4.
The library also provides a binding to the Linux Packet Filter (LPF) system.

The Anet BSD socket implementation has the following features:

* Supported socket families
  - IPv4 (AF_INET)
  - IPv6 (AF_INET6)
